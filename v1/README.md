#stamp2date v1.0

A firefox add-on that converts timestamp to date/datetime, simply by hovering over the timestamp with your mouse.

At this point it only works with html table cells that contain timestamps, like in phpmyadmin (what i primarily built it for).

Only works for Firefox versions ealier than version 45.
